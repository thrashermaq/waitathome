# Wait at Home

App created in the CodeVsCovid19 hackaton in Switzerland. With the hacking boys Nils, Hoang, Luca and Ralf.
The app should be a convenient solution for stores to track how many people are inside.
For people who want to do grocery shopping it offers an easy way to check if it is worth going to
the shops or better wait at home and wait for fewer people.

## Main Goal
Create a save environment for both customers and employees in stores by reducing the number of people in stores and eliminate huge queues in front of stores.

## Setup
- run `flutter packages get`
- run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to create json converter methods

## Things to know
